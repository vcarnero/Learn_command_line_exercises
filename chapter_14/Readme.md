#Can you remove blah.txt?
rm blah.txt


#Let's get rid of our development log file.
rm development.log

#Can you remove everything in the slash temp slash foo directory?
rm -rf foo directory
removed everything in the directory but I didnt have much in it.


#DANGER: Why is it dangerous to run "rm -rf /". DO NOT RUN THIS COMMAND. Simply explain in the Readme.md why it's a very bad idea..

This would be a very very very bad idea because it would essentially remove everything from the machine...yep, not good.
