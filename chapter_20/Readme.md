#APROPOS

NAME
       apropos - search the whatis database for strings

SYNOPSIS
       apropos keyword ...

DESCRIPTION
       apropos searches a set of database files containing short descriptions of system commands for keywords
       and displays the result on the standard output.

AUTHOR
       John W. Eaton was the original author of man.  Zeyd M. Ben-Halim released man 1.2, and Andries Brouwer
       followed up with versions 1.3 thru 1.5p.  Federico Lucifredi <flucifredi@acm.org> is the current main-
       tainer.

YAY.Not sure that I will use this command that much as the chapter implies that google searches are better and apropos is more or less a last resort type of command to use.
